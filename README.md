# MazeBot
- **main idea** - use neville and build an algorithm that allows neville to solve a maze

- **application** - the maze could for example represent a dangerous situation, neville could learn the layout of the maze and then apply this knowlege to get to the exist of hte maze 
	- *real world* - neville could maybe represent a robot that needs to help someone get out of danger quickly, for example if a child is in a collapsing house neville would know the fastest way out of the house
		- *voice commands* 
		- *danger* - neville finds exit as fast as possible
		- *outside* - neville finds the exist at a normal speed
	
- **demo** - the demo could work in two stages 
	- **learn the layout** ~ nevil learns the layout of a never before seen maze 
	- **find the exist** ~ nevil finds the exit as fast as possible

- **software and hardware** 
	- **software** ~ matlab
	- **hardware** ~ mindstorms
